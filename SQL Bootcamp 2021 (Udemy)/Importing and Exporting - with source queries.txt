* Importing and Exporting functionalities for .csv files into tables and from tables respectively
	>> Not all files are compatible (formatting, data types, macros, etc...) - some transformation/edits may be required
	>> Importing DOES NOT create a table - it assumes a table already exists and is properly formatted for the file 

-----

* We are operating in myFirstDB for testing

:: Create a table that is formatted for the file we are importing (basic_file_to_import.csv)

CREATE TABLE simple(
	a INTEGER,
	b INTEGER,
	c INTEGER
);

:: After using the graphical interface to import the file, check the correct columns, set the header and delimiter - we check it

SELECT * FROM simple;

:: You can then export using the grpahical interface (very easy)
