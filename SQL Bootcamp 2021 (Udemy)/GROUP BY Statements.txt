* Aggregation functions allow us to combine data together using some type of functional logic
	>> There are many aggregation functions but the most common are:
		AVG() 	-- Average (Use ROUND() to specify precision - wrap arpund the aggregate function)
		COUNT() -- Number of values
		MAX() 	-- Max value
		MIN() 	-- Min value
		SUM()	-- Sum of all values

> GROUP BY: Used to aggregate data and apply aggregate functions (from above) -- must directly follow FROM and WHERE statements
	$ SELECT c1, AGG_FUNCTION(c2) FROM t GROUP BY c1 		 -- aggregates data per catageory of c1
	$ SELECT c1, c2 SUM(c3) FROM t GROUP BY c1, c2			 -- Any columns being grouped must be in the SELECT statement as well
	$ SELECT c1, SUM(c2) FROM t GROUP BY c1 ORDER BY SUM(c2) -- To sort by an aggregate function, it must be applied in the ORDER BY

> DATE: Used to convert a timestamp column to a date value
	$ SELECT DATE(date_column) FROM t GROUP BY DATE(date_column)

> HAVING: Used to filter after the aggregation step
	>> We can use WHERE to filter before a GROUP BY statement
	>> We can use HAVING to filter after aggregating some data (filtering the aggregated data)

	$
	SELECT c1, SUM(c2) 
	FROM t 
	WHERE c1 != "something"
	GROUP BY c1
	HAVING SUM(c2) > some_value
