> SQL = Structured Query Language --> Queries can be used/adapted across different software
	+ How we communicate with a Database software

> Databases are systems that allow users to store/organize data -- usually large amounts of data

> Benefits:
	+ Data Integrity
	+ Handles Large amounts of Data
	+ Run operations to quickly combine/filter/etc... data 
	+ Automation of steps
	+ Supports data for websites and applications

> Programs: PostGreSQL, SQLite (Python Module for this), MySQL/MariaSQL, MS SQL Server Express

> To create a database from a file (.tar)
	1. Create a DB
	2. Restore (finds file to load)
	3. In restore options, set Pre-data, Data and Post-data to True (Yes)
	4. Refresh the DB

> Access Queries with the "Query Tool" (used to write queries to the DB)
> Access Tables through "Schemas" --> "Tables" (Where the data is actually represented)
